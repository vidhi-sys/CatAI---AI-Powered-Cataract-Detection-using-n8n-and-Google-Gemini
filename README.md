# 👁️ CatAI – AI-Powered Cataract Detection using n8n + Google Gemini

CatAI is a small but powerful workflow that analyzes eye images and detects cataract stages automatically.  
It’s built entirely in **n8n**, powered by **Google Gemini**, and returns clean, structured results ready for integration into any healthcare app.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Detects whether a cataract is present in an uploaded eye image  
- Classifies the **stage** (Early, Immature, Mature, Hypermature)  
- Returns an **intensity score**, **confidence level**, and **recommendation**  
- Outputs everything as neat JSON — no manual data cleaning required  
- Runs on a simple n8n workflow — no complex backend or heavy ML setup

## ⚙️ How the Workflow Runs

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Webhook Trigger] --> B[Google Gemini Model];
    B --> C["AI Agent Node (Cataract Analysis Prompt)"];
    C --> D[Structured Output Parser];
    D --> E[JSON Response to User];
````

**Step-by-step:**

1. You upload an eye image to the webhook endpoint.
2. Google Gemini analyzes it using the custom cataract prompt.
3. The AI Agent interprets the cataract stage and related details.
4. The Structured Output Parser enforces a consistent JSON schema.
5. The response is sent back instantly — clear, formatted, and ready.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CatAI.git
cd CatAI
```

### 2. Import Workflow

* Open your n8n dashboard → **Workflows → Import from File**
* Choose `n8n_workflow/CatAI.json`
* Update your **Google Gemini API credentials**

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
n8n start
```

Then test it by sending an image:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/cat-ai \
  -F "image=@examples/sample_input.jpg"
```
